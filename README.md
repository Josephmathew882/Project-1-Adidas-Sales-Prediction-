# [Project 1: Adidas Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Josephmathew882/Project-1-Adidas-Sales-Prediction-)

Aim of this  project is to predict the total sales of global brand Adidas in each transactions by processing its dataset using suitable Machine Learning algorithm.

* Data             - Data set is taken from Kaggle and this dataset include details such as the number of units sold, the total sales, the location of the sales, the 
                     type of product sold, and other relevant information.
* Technique Used   -  The target value in this dataset is continous so to anlyse this data we should use regression methods
* Processes Used   - Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Cross Validation, Hypertunning and Prediction
* Algorithms Used  - Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regressor, K-Neighbours Regressor, Support Vector Regressor
* Conclusion       - From the cross validation analysis it is evident that Random Forest Regressor is best suitable algorithm for the given data set and using Random 
                      Forest Regressor Model we predicted the target values which is total sales of Adidas product with a model score of 99.9%.
